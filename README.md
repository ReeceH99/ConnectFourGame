## Description

Welcome to my Connect Four game! This project is a classic implementation of the popular Connect Four game created using C# programming language and the SplashKit library. Connect Four is a two-player game where the objective is to connect four of your colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## Features

- Varying Difficulties of AI Opponent: The game allows for playing in three different difficulty modes - easy, medium and hard. 
- Colorful Graphics: The game features an engaging graphical interface created with the SplashKit library.
- Interactive Gameplay: Players can select columns to drop their discs, and the game checks for a winning combination after each move.
- Win Detection: The game accurately detects when a player has achieved a winning combination of four discs in a row.
- Score Tracking: The screen displays how many wins each player has got. 

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the SplashKit library installed.
